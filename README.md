After that, run the script on a machine where there is google cloud terminal application. At the end you will mainly found some interesting db such as:
* access_tokens.db
* credentials.db
* default_configs.db

# Analysis of google cloud terminal app databases

The databases are made with sqlite, but they are encrypted to view the content of those db, it is suggested to download **sqlcipher**:
```
sudo apt install -y sqlcipher
```
After installing it, run:
```
sqlcipher DB
```
Where DB may be:
* access_tokens.db
* credentials.db
